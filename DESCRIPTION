Description: Interface for working with large matrices stored in files, not in computer memory.
     Supports multiple data types (double, integer, logical and raw) of various sizes (e.g. 8 and 4 byte real values).
     Access to parts of the matrix is done by indexing (e.g. fm[,1]), exactly as with usual R matrices.
     Supports very large matrices (tested on multi-terabyte matrices), allowing for more than 2^32 rows or columns.
     Allows for quick addition of extra columns to a filematrix.
     Cross-platform as the package has R code only.
