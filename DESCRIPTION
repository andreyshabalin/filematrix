Description: Interface for working with large matrices stored in files,
  not in computer memory. Supports multiple non-character
  data types (double, integer, logical and raw) of
  various sizes (e.g. 8 and 4 byte real values).
  Access to parts of the matrix is done by indexing, 
  exactly as with usual R matrices.
  Supports very large matrices.
  Tested on multi-terabyte matrices.
  Allows for more than 2^32 rows or columns.
  Allows for quick addition of extra columns to a filematrix.
  Cross-platform as the package has R code only.
